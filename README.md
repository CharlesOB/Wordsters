## Orientation
When I was a kid, my family used to play word games. This included Scrabble, Boggle, and others. One of these was Wordsters. Wordsters was by far the most frequestly played word game we owned and was always the "go-to" game for our family. Was I particularly good at it? I would like to say I was, but I was average at best. To be good at the game seemed to require a memorized dictionary. How could I improve my game play intelligently without resorting to such a feat? Surely not every word was as valuable as the next. A computer program could definitely help me improve my game, but first, how does the game work?

Here is the gist: Wordsters is a board game published in 1991 by Milton Bradley in which players compete by thinking of words that follow a given three-letter pattern. Players then write the words on a secret personal score sheet. During a round of word declaration, players take turns declaring words on their score sheets. Players are awarded 1 point for declaring words that other players do not have, and 2 points for declaring words that other players do have on their score sheets. Once a player has declared a word, no other player may declare the same word for the rest of the round. 

Words follow the three-letter pattern if they contain the three letters in order, but with any number of letters in between them. For example, if the pattern was "OTI", acceptable matches could include "MOTION", "CONSTELLATION", "OSTRICH", "LOTIS", etc. Each of these words contains the letters o, t, and i in that order, but may have letters between them.

## Problem
From this simple set of rules, a few answerable questions come to mind. <br/>
In this game, what are the words that match the most three letter patterns? I want to memorize these before we play the game since they are the most likely to match any given pattern. <br/>
What are the easiest and hardest three-letter patterns? I could memorize words that belong to the hardest patterns. <br/>
Given a three-letter pattern, how does it rank in difficulty against all other possible patterns? I am just curious. <br/> 
Given a word, how does it rank in usefulness against all other possible words? I am also curious about this one.
